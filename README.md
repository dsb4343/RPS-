# RPS-
Rock Paper Scissors game, using Node.js
This project was very challenging overall, and also somewhat time consuming.
I learned quite a bit between Programming I using Javascript and Computer Systems Studio II using Node.js
When we combined the RPS project into node, it created numerous problems at first, which I had to restructure
the functions and rework some other parts of the code from the RPS game, in order to get it working on the Node
server. One of the biggest challenges was getting everything to display properly between the two different player
choices across the server client in Node. The only thing I was unable to get working properly is having the same 
information dislay properly on each host clients. In the end I ran short on time and just dedcided to turn in 
what I had. I will continue to work on this project, and should be able to fix my issues once I develop a better
understanding of how Node.js works.
